# TaskTrack

TaskTrack is a console-based task management application written in Python.  
It allows users to create, view, complete, and delete tasks, with all data
persisted using a JSON file so that tasks are retained between sessions.

This project was built to demonstrate clean Python logic, object-oriented
programming principles, and reliable data handling.
